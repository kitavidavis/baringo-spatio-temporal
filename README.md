Spatio-temporal analysis of the lake Baringo catchment.

The water levels of Lake Baringo have been rising tremendously. This is posing great threat to humanity living near the lake. To understand the reasons behind this phenomena,
Kenya Red Cross, in partnership with the Technical University of Kenya, undertook a joint project. Various factors such as soil loss, population and the land use/land cover of 
the catchment was considered. The codes herein are for the various dashboards that visualize various spatial-temporal data.
